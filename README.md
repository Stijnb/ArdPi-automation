ArdPi-automation
================

ArdPi will be a home automation system that is programmed in Python.
We will use a Raspberry Pi as main controller and arduino board to connect the push button's, lights, ...
The connection between the RPI and the arduino go over RS-485 and will use the modbus protocol.

The arduino boards will just act as slaves and will send the state of input's en output's to de RPI.
The entire program will run on the RPI.

We will also develope I/O expanders for the arduino's.
